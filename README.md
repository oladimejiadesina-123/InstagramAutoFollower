We could use this to follow others automatically. As instagram stopped support for bots we have to do something like these to automate instagram. This JavaScript code will help you to follow other people automatically. This would help you gain more followers.
## How to use?
You can use this in two pages, suggested and also on other poples followers dialog box. Let's see how to use this code in detail.

### In Suggested Page
* Go to https://www.instagram.com/explore/people/suggested/
* Now copy the full code and paste it in the console of your browser (you can open console by inspecting from the page).
* Make sure the argument passed in the FunctionMain("suggested") is suggested.
* Check the last line of the code, make sure its like below.
```
FunctionMain("suggested");
```

### In Other Peoples Followers Dialog Box
* Go to the page similar to your instagram page and then click their followers (Now a pop up will be visible).
* Now copy the full code and paste it in the console of your browser (you can open console by inspecting from the page).
* Make sure the argument passed in the FunctionMain("othersfollowers") is othersfollowers.
* Check the last line of the code, make sure its like below.
```
FunctionMain("othersfollowers");
```

That's all, copy paste the code and hit enter. Now leave the tab open, it will automatically follow other people.
